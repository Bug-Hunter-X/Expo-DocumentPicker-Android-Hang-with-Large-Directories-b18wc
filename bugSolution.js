This solution uses a third-party library such as react-native-fs or similar to select files from a large directory. This avoids the performance issues of the native picker. The following example is illustrative and requires adapting to a specific file system library. 

```javascript
import RNFS from 'react-native-fs';

async function selectFileFromLargeDirectory() {
  try {
    const directoryPath = '/path/to/large/directory'; // Replace with your path
    const files = await RNFS.readDir(directoryPath);
    const fileOptions = files.map((file) => ({ 
       id: file.name,
       name: file.name,
       type: file.type // Or derive type from extension
    }));

     //Use the fileOptions to present a list in your UI

     // ... Handle file selection ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading directory:', error);
  }
}
```

This approach provides a more robust and performant solution for selecting files from large directories on Android, avoiding the limitations of Expo's built-in DocumentPicker with large directory sets.
